## Previous Years

This year the focus is the use and analysis of large and complex data. Notes from previous years can be found at the following links: 

* In [2017](https://pi4-uiuc.github.io/2017-bootcamp/) the course was two-weeks long and included additional materials on cloud computing and machine learning.
* In previous years, courses focused more on numerical analysis. Materials from [2016](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hirani/cbmg/index.html), [2015](http://math.illinois.edu/~shahkar2/cbmg/), [2014](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hirani/teaching/cbmgsu14) are available through these links.
